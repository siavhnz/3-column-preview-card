## My process

### Workflow
 
 - Setting up the workflow
 - Creating HTML skeleton based on design assets `./assets/design/*`
 - Setting up CSS preflight (Prepare reset css, Add Google fonts, Identify CSS custom properties)
 - Working on mobile design
 - Working on Desktop design
 - Write README.md
 - publish on github.io | github.com | frontendmentor.io

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

`align-items:flex-start;` in `.item` class made all children's width like `button` as it must be (in size of its content)



### Continued development

I will Read and Practice more about Flexbox in the upcoming challenge solution
